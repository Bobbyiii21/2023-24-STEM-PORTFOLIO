  abstract  = {Currently, there is a growing public interest in improving the quality of life of people with disabilities, being the visual limitation one of them, where different research projects have been developed. Assistance robotics is a branch dedicated to the support in mobility and rehabilitation of people with visual disabilities and other limitations. This work describes the construction and use of a robotic cane to assist people with visual problems. The robot structure is generated by 3D printing, and the electronic system has been designed based on Arduino technology. The robot features include a sensor distance to detect possible collisions, a GPS to track its movements, and two DC motors in caterpillar-like configuration for cane mobility. In addition, the robot has connectivity with mobile devices through Bluetooth communication, where the mobile application coordinates the movements of the robot in two ways, manual and autonomous, allowing to reach the desired location and sending the user's location to the web. This proposal is tested in a structured environment so that patients cast their perspective through a usability test and their characteristics are examined through the analysis of an expert.},

  abstract  = {Do-It-Yourself (DIY) and open design approaches allow for the development of customized, affordable assistive technologies. Freely shared designs and software components open doors for new ways to create and to share technology, representing an approach that has the potential to be more efficient, affordable, and effective than commercial approaches to Assistive Technology development and deployment. In this paper, we present a case study of how these methods have been used to develop a DIY, open-source Speech-Generating Device.},
