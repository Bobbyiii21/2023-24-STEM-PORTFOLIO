# 2022 - 2023 STEM Portfolio
Greetings, my name is Bobby Stephens III. I am a senior in The STEM Institute at Newton College and Career Academy in Covington, Georgia. This repository is a showcase of my work that falls under the Newton County School System's Portrait of a Graduate. The portfolio is broken down into the following sections:

- [Collaborative](Collaborative)
- [Creative Thinker](Creative%20Thinker)
- [Critical Thinking](Critical%20Thinking)
- [Employable](Employable)
- [Empowered](Empowered)
- [Future Thinker](Future%20Thinker)
- [Knowledge Seeker](Knowledge%20Seeker)
- [Resilient](Resilient)
- [Resourceful](Resourceful)

If any of the links are broken, it is highly likely that there is no content for that section yet. Please check back later for updates.
