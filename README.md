# 2022 - 2023 STEM Portfolio
Greetings, my name is Bobby Stephens III. I am a senior in The STEM Institute at Newton College and Career Academy in Covington, Georgia. This repository is a showcase of my work that falls under the Newton County School System's Portrait of a Graduate. The portfolio is broken down into the following sections:

- [Collaborative](#collaborative)
- [Creative Thinker](#creative-thinker)
- [Critical Thinking](#critical-thinker)
- [Employable](#employable)
- [Empowered](#empowered)
- [Future Thinker](#future-thinker)
- [Knowledge Seeker](#knowledge-seeker)
- [Resilient](#resilient)
- [Resourceful](#resourceful)

If any of the links are broken, it is highly likely that there is no content for that section yet. Please check back later for updates.
