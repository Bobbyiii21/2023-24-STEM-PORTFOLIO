The completion of this annotated bibliography on solutions for affordable solutions to assistive technology allowed me to display and sharpen my skills in the search for accurate sources and relevance to my research lens. In the search for my seven sources, I diligently explored large databases full of scholarly and peer-reviewed articles and conference papers. My search was assisted greatly by my understanding of effective search techniques, such as boolean searching or keyword searching.
